	give me step by step process of your frame work
	how did you build bdd frame work
	
	step 1==we build feature file==login.feature
	step 2== based on feature file we build step defination ==loginTest
	step 3==based on loginTest we build LoginPage with page object model
	step 4= we build a BaseTest for inheritance to reuse common code such as
	         a. open application
	         b. close application
	         c. take screen shot
	         d. some assertion
	step 5= we build runner class to run Junit== stepRunner
	          a. plugin= for reporting
	          b. snippet = for camel case
	          c. feature == from Feature folder
	          c. tags= to filter what to run or not run
	          d. glue==to find out where is the code or step are.
	          
	  explain me your BDD frame work
	  what your BDD frame work contain
	  what is in your BDD frame work
	  
	  in my frame work I have feature folder where I have all my features with tag.
	  I also have all my step defination classes in my step defination folder to 
	  execute my test
	  I have pages where i develop page object model style code for step defination.
	  I created a Base test where I build is-a-relation or inheritance to write 
	  common code to reuse throughout for whole project such as open application,
	  close application and so on.
	  My frame work is design to build pretty cucumber html report for stake holder.
